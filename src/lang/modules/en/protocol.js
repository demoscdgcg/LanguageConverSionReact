    </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 2em;margin-top: 25px;"><span style="font-size: 14px">(I) We value the security of personal data. We use appropriate physical, administrative and technical safeguards to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, modification, damage or loss. For example, we use encryption technology to ensure the confidentiality of data; we use protection mechanisms to prevent data from malicious attacks; we deploy access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized personnel can access personal data; and we hold security and privacy protection training courses to enhance employees' awareness of the importance of protecting personal data. We will do our best to protect your personal data, but please note that no security measures can be impeccable.</span></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;margin-top: 25px;"><span style="font-size: 14px">(II) We will retain your personal data for the period necessary to achieve the purposes described in this policy, unless the retention period needs to be extended or is permitted by law. Because the storage period of data may vary based on different scenarios and products and services, the standards we use to determine the retention period include: the time it takes to retain personal data to complete the business purpose, including providing products and services, maintaining corresponding transaction and business records, controlling and improving product and service performance and quality, ensuring the security of systems, products and services, responding to possible user inquiries or complaints, problem location, etc.; whether the user agrees to a longer retention period; whether there are special requirements for retaining data under laws, contracts, etc. As long as your account is necessary to provide you with services, we will retain your registration information. You can also choose to cancel your account. After you cancel your account, we will stop providing products and services based on the account and delete your corresponding personal data unless there are special legal requirements.</span></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;margin-top: 25px;"><span style="font-size: 14px">(III) In the unfortunate event of a personal information security incident, we will inform you in accordance with the requirements of laws and regulations (within 30 natural days at the latest): the basic situation and possible impact of the security incident, the disposal measures we have taken or will take, suggestions for you to prevent and reduce risks on your own, and remedial measures for you, etc. We will inform you of the relevant circumstances of the incident by email, letter, phone, push notification, etc. When it is difficult to inform the subject of personal information one by one, we will take reasonable and effective means to issue an announcement. At the same time, we will also report the disposal of the personal information security incident in accordance with the requirements of the regulatory authorities.</span></p>
